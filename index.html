        <h3><b>I like old computing, cars and saabs! </b></h3>
        The reason for me creating this is for learning and to show that I can code in HTML.

        Online my most common username is 'SwedishBoi' or some variation of it.

        If you see me around online just say hi! I don't bite. Just be friendly and I'll be the same!
